🔦 Laser Puzzle: Manual & Guide

Welcome to the Laser Puzzle! Your objective is to manipulate laser beams using mirrors and splitters to hit all targets on the grid. As you progress, you will encounter complex color-based puzzles.


The Objective:

Direct the laser beam from the source (K) to hit all targets (H or color-coded targets) in the level. Once all targets are hit simultaneously, you advance to the next level.

Symbol	        Name	    	Function

K		Source		The starting point of the laser. It cannot be moved.
H		Target		The main objective in early levels. Must be hit by the beam.
#		Wall		Blocks the laser beam entirely.
/ or \		Mirrors		Reflects the laser beam at a 90-degree angle.
+		Splitter	Splits the beam into two perpendicular directions.
.		Empty Space	Where you can place or remove objects.


Advanced Color Mechanics (Level 4+):

Starting from Level 4, the game introduces color filters and color-coded targets. A target will only be "hit" if the laser beam matching its color reaches it.

Filters (R, G, B): Passing the beam through these changes the laser's color.

	R: Changes laser to Red.

	G: Changes laser to Green.

	B: Changes laser to Blue.
	

Color-Coded Targets:

	HR (x): Only triggered by a Red laser.

	HG (y): Only triggered by a Green laser.

	HB (z): Only triggered by a Blue laser.

How to Control:

The game is played by entering coordinates and the object type in the following format: [row] [column] [object]

Examples:

	5 5 / : Places a mirror (/) at row 5, column 5.

	2 3 + : Places a splitter (+) at row 2, column 3.

	5 5 . : Clears the object at 5, 5 by replacing it with a dot.

System Commands:

	-1 : Exit the game.

	-2 : Reset the current level (re-generates obstacles and targets).


Pro Tips:

Mirror Logic: * If the beam comes from the left, a / mirror sends it Up, and a \ mirror sends it Down.

Splitters are Key: Use the + object when you have multiple targets in different directions.

Pathfinding: If a wall is blocking your path, look for a way to bounce the laser around it using multiple mirrors.

Touch Grass: If you reach Level 100, the game developer highly recommends going outside for some fresh air!
